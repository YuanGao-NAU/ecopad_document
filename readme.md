This repo is a document which will guide you to install [EcoPAD](https://ecolab.nau.edu/ecopad) of [Dr. Yiqi Luo's EcoLAB](https://www2.nau.edu/luo-lab/).

## System requirements

To run the EcoPAD on your computer, you need to meet the following requirements for your computer if you are running Linux. For the Virtual Machines, allocate the required resources:

```
Number of cores: â‰¥ 2
RAM: 4GB
Disk: 100GB (required)
```

### Windows

For Windows users, you may install either **[VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)** or **[VMware WorkStation](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-pro/workstation-pro-evaluation.html)** on your computer and set up a **Ubuntu 20.04** virtual machine to do the following steps.

### Ubuntu (Linux)

For Linux users, you may install **Docker** on your computer. **Ubuntu 20.04** is highly recommended.

### MacOS

For MacOS users, you may try to apply for a personal use license for **[VMware Fusion](https://www.vmware.com/products/fusion.html)** and install a **Ubuntu 20.04** virtual machine to do the following steps.

## Install Docker on Ubuntu

```Bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install \
    apt-transport-https \
    ca-certificates \
    curl \
    gnupg \
    lsb-release
```

```Bash
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg
```

```Bash
echo \
  "deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
```

**Note: If there's anything wrong and you can not install Docker, just repeat the process.**

Use the following commands to add current user to the docker user group.
```Bash
sudo groupadd docker
sudo usermod -a -G docker $USER
newgrp docker
```

## Download the essential files

All the files can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kDOSnQFzHOhcRhrey65lWKaSdBddNUlz/view?usp=sharing), you need to extract it and put the folder **images_saved** under your home folder (**/home/your_user_name**).

## Install all the docker images

Extract the files and then put the images_saved folder under your home, then locate to the folder:
```Bash
cd /home/YOUR_USER_NAME/images_saved
```

Run the following commands to install all the images:

```
docker load -i api.tar
docker load -i celery.tar
docker load -i memcached.tar
docker load -i mongo.tar
docker load -i nginx.tar
docker load -i rabbitmq.tar
docker load -i test.tar
```
## Modify the configuration

Once you have installed all the docker images, you need to make some modification to the **restart_docker** file. Open it with a text editor and replace the **host_ip**
 with your own ip address. Once you down, save and close the file.
 
## Use Key instead of password to log in to your computer

First, locate to the folder:

```Bash
cd /home/YOUR_USER_NAME/.ssh
```

Run the following command to create a new key:

```Bash
ssh-keygen # You don't have to input anything, just use Enter to continue
```

If you didn't change the name of the key, the path of the private key should be:

```
/home/YOUR_USER_NAME/.ssh/id_rsa
```

And the public key should be:

```
/home/YOUR_USER_NAME/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

Open the ssh service config file:

```
sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

Add the following 3 lines:

```
RSAAuthentication yes 
PubkeyAuthentication yes
AuthorizedKeysFile  .ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

## Launch the docker containers

Locate to the folder and run the script:

```Bash
cd /home/YOUR_USER_NAME/images_saved
touch thisisfirstrun
bash restart_docker
```

## Test EcoPAD

Open [this link](http://127.0.0.1/api/queue) and login use the username and password you have already known. At this time you may follow the PDF file we used before to
 test the **test** api.
